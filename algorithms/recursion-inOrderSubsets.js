RECURSION: In-Order Subsets (pg. 101)
Create a strSubsets(str), return an array with every possible
in-order character subset of str. The result array itself does not 
need to be in any specific order--it is the subset of letters in each 
string that must be in the same order as they were in the original.

INPUT (str) => "abc"
OUTPUT (arr) => ["", "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc"]
